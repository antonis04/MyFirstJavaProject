# Java Alarm Clock Project

Welcome to **Java Alarm Clock Project**! This repository is designed for learners starting out with Java and provides a functional alarm clock application.

## Description

This project is a beginner-friendly Java application that simulates an alarm clock. It demonstrates the fundamentals of Java programming, including:

- Object-oriented programming concepts
- Working with dates and times
- Handling user input
- Managing threads for scheduling tasks

The project is simple yet practical, making it a great starting point for students and new Java developers.

## Features

- **Set Alarms**: Users can set alarms for specific times.
- **Custom Messages**: Display custom messages when the alarm goes off.
- **Snooze Functionality**: Option to snooze the alarm for a few minutes.
- **Thread Management**: Uses multithreading to handle alarm scheduling.
